Test for AKQA  
By James A B Gray  
23rd September 2014  


How I complted the test:  

1. Created a repo on github and set up remote origin.

3. Created a project file in sumblime text and commited to repo (normally I would create a git ignore file however this project dicated all code and configs be pushed).

2. Created a file structure based on src folder for dev, a test folder to run tests in dev and prior to crating the distruibution code and a public folder (essentially dist folder) where the css & js will be uglified via grunt as well as the supplied folder containing the supplied files for the project.

3. Created the bower.json and .bowerrc files to install jquery & modinizer in my src/libs directory. *NOTE: I also installed jQuery Migrate so as to make sure backwards compatibility with IE8 and lower. I'm assuming this is OK as its not a plugin as such
